> **The world's first fully auditable RF communication system - every action is traceable, every signal is documented, every component is certified.**

## 🎯 Why Auditable RF?

- **🔐 Complete Transparency** - Every RF action is fully traceable
- **🎯 Real Hardware** - No simulations, no mocks, real RF systems
- **🧩 Modular Design** - Add your own protocols and hardware
- **⚖️ Built-in Compliance** - Automatic regulatory compliance checking
